     *     used in {@code equals} comparisons on the object is modified.
     *     This integer need not remain consistent from one execution of an
     *     application to another execution of the same application.
     *     <p>
     *         在程序执行期间，只要在同一对象上多次调用它，{@code hashCode}方法就必须始终返回相同的整数，
     *         前提是在该对象的{@code equals}比较中使用的信息没有被修改。
     *     </p>
     * <li>If two objects are equal according to the {@code equals(Object)}
     *     method, then calling the {@code hashCode} method on each of
     *     the two objects must produce the same integer result.
     *     <p>
     *         如果根据 {@code equals(Object)} 方法两个对象相等，
     *         则在两个对象中的每个对象上调用{@code hashCode}方法必须产生相同的整数结果。
     *     </p>
     * <li>It is <em>not</em> required that if two objects are unequal
     *     according to the {@link java.lang.Object#equals(java.lang.Object)}
     *     method, then calling the {@code hashCode} method on each of the
     *     two objects must produce(v.	生产、产生) distinct integer results.  However, the
     *     programmer should be aware that producing distinct integer results
     *     for unequal objects may improve the performance of hash tables.
     *     <p>
     *         并不要求当 {@link java.lang.Object#equals(java.lang.Object)} 返回 true 的时候，
     *         {@code hashCode} 必须返回相同的 Integer，但要知道(be aware that)返回相同但 Integer
     *         能够提高 hash tables 的性能。

     * <p>

     * objects. (This is typically implemented by converting the internal(内部的)

     * technique is not required by the
     * Java&trade; programming language.)
     * <p>
     *     在合理可行的范围内，由{@code Object}定义的 hashCode 方法确实为不同的对象返回不同的整数。

     * the return type of the {@code clone} method of an array type {@code T[]}
     * is {@code T[]} where T is any reference or primitive type(基本类型).
     * Otherwise, this method creates a new instance of the class of this
     * object and initializes all its fields with exactly(adv. 准确地；精确地 网络 正是；恰恰) the contents of
     * the corresponding fields of this object, as if by assignment(赋值); the
     * contents of the fields are not themselves cloned. Thus, this method
     * performs(v. 执行；表现) a "shallow copy" of this object, not a "deep copy" operation.
     * <p>
     *    {@code Object}的方法{@code clone}执行特定的克隆操作。
     *    首先，如果此对象的类未实现接口{@code Cloneable}，则将引发{@code CloneNotSupportedException}。
     *    请注意，所有数组都被视为实现了接口{@code Cloneable}，
     *    数组类型为{@code T []}的{@code clone}方法的返回类型为{@code T []}，
     *    其中T为任何引用或基本类型。 否则，此方法将创建此对象的类的新实例，
     *    并使用该对象相应字段的内容精确初始化其所有字段，就像通过赋值一样；
     *    字段的内容本身不会被克隆。 因此，此方法执行此对象的“浅复制”，而不是“深复制”操作。
     * <p>
     * The class {@code Object} does not itself implement the interface
     * {@code Cloneable}, so calling the {@code clone} method on an object
     * whose class is {@code Object} will result in throwing an
     * exception at run time.
     * <p>

     * The current thread must own this object's monitor. The thread

     * either through a call to the {@code notify} method or the
     * {@code notifyAll} method. The thread then waits until it can
     * re-obtain ownership of the monitor and resumes execution.
     * <p>
     * As in the one argument version, interrupts and spurious wakeups are

     * This method should only be called by a thread that is the owner
     * of this object's monitor. See the {@code notify} method for a
     * description of the ways in which a thread can become the owner of
     * a monitor.
     *
     * @throws  IllegalMonitorStateException  if the current thread is not
     *               the owner of the object's monitor.

     * Called by the garbage collector on an object when garbage collection
     * determines that there are no more references to the object.
     * A subclass overrides the {@code finalize} method to dispose of
     * system resources or to perform other cleanup.
     * <p>
     * The general contract of {@code finalize} is that it is invoked
     * if and when the Java&trade; virtual
     * machine has determined that there is no longer any
     * means by which this object can be accessed by any thread that has
     * not yet died, except as a result of an action taken by the
     * finalization of some other object or class which is ready to be
     * finalized. The {@code finalize} method may take any action, including
     * making this object available again to other threads; the usual purpose
     * of {@code finalize}, however, is to perform cleanup actions before
     * the object is irrevocably discarded. For example, the finalize method
     * for an object that represents an input/output connection might perform
     * explicit I/O transactions to break the connection before the object is
     * permanently discarded.
     * <p>
     * The {@code finalize} method of class {@code Object} performs no
     * special action; it simply returns normally. Subclasses of
     * {@code Object} may override this definition.
     * <p>
     * The Java programming language does not guarantee which thread will
     * invoke the {@code finalize} method for any given object. It is
     * guaranteed, however, that the thread that invokes finalize will not
     * be holding any user-visible synchronization locks when finalize is
     * invoked. If an uncaught exception is thrown by the finalize method,
     * the exception is ignored and finalization of that object terminates.
     * <p>
     * After the {@code finalize} method has been invoked for an object, no
     * further action is taken until the Java virtual machine has again
     * determined that there is no longer any means by which this object can
     * be accessed by any thread that has not yet died, including possible
     * actions by other objects or classes which are ready to be finalized,
     * at which point the object may be discarded.
     * <p>
     * The {@code finalize} method is never invoked more than once by a Java
     * virtual machine for any given object.
     * <p>
     * Any exception thrown by the {@code finalize} method causes
     * the finalization of this object to be halted, but is otherwise
     * ignored.
     *
     * @throws Throwable the {@code Exception} raised by this method
